# Breakout-ball-Game-
A "Breakout Ball Game" in Java is a popular arcade-style game where the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen, moving it horizontally to bounce a ball upwards toward a grid of bricks positioned at the top. The goal is to clear all the bricks by making the ball collide with them while preventing the ball from falling below the paddle. The paddle is controlled using keyboard inputs, and the ball follows simple 2D physics, bouncing off walls, the paddle, and the bricks upon collision. Each time the ball hits a brick, the brick is destroyed, and the game continues until either all the bricks are cleared or the player loses all their lives by failing to keep the ball in play. Players typically have a limited number of lives, and their score increases as more bricks are destroyed.

The game is implemented using Java's AWT or Swing libraries for rendering graphics and handling user input. Core game mechanics such as collision detection between the ball, paddle, bricks, and walls are managed through Java code. A continuous game loop is used to update the positions of the game objects, check for collisions, and redraw the screen at regular intervals. Additional features like power-ups can be incorporated to enhance gameplay, such as enlarging the paddle, adding extra balls, or slowing the ball's speed. This game serves as an excellent project for learning Java, as it involves object-oriented programming principles, graphical user interface development, and game logic implementation.


You should be able to achieve these goals at the end of the game:
 1  The player should be able to start the game by pressing the ENTER key.
 2  The player should be able to move the paddle horizontally using left and right arrow keys on the keyboard.
 3  Once the player loses the ball, i.e. when the ball touches the bottom of the window, the game ends.
 4  Breaking each brick should provide the player a certain score. Let’s say each brick contains 5 points, if a player breaks 10 such bricks, he gets a score of 50.
 5  At the end of the game, the terminal will present the player’s final score and give him the option to restart the game again.
